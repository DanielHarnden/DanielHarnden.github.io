            <div class="left fadeDiv">
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Version 0.0.013 and 0.00.014 - 1/10/24</h2>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>New Year's Update</b></h2><br>
                <p>Version 0.0.013 was a purely development build where I focussed on adding new features for later in the story, so you don't get any of them for the demo. Sucks.</p>
                <p>Version 0.0.014 was just a bunch of random stuff I added and updated to improve QoL and such. I barely have any idea what I added, but there was stuff! Check it out!</p>
                <p>Oh yeah, multiplayer and weekly challenges were removed temporarily. Multiplayer adds far too much to the scope than I am able to handle at this point, and weekly challenges are extra fluff I don't have time to conceptualize at this point either. Both features are intended to be readded at some point in the future, so don't worry Clippy Commando Local Multiplayer and Clippy Commando Weekly Challenge fans.</p>
                <p>Last major update: Clippy Commando now has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Beanmeister12">YouTube channel</a> and a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/danielharnden.bsky.social">BlueSky</a> account! Go check those out, please and thank you.</p>

                <br><h2><b>New Features</b></h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I updated the UI, I know that much.</li>
                    <li>Unlocking stuff has a cool animation now! Instead of the dumb words it was before. I hate reading.</li>
                    <li>Trees and bushes were overhauled (this was not a rushed feature and surely has no negative impact on performance).</li>
                    <li>New challenges! But not for the demo. Why even live.</li>
                </ul>

                <br><h2><b>Bug Fixes</b></h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some of them!</li>
                    <li>Honestly I probably just added even more bugs. Such is life.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>



            <div class="left fadeDiv">

                <p style="font-size: 16px">With Next Fest imminent, we're going to switch primarily to bug fixes as (hopefully) an influx of new players report just how broken and unoptimized the game really is.</p>

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Version 0.0.011 - 9/27/24</h2>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Local Multiplayer Update</b></h2>
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Commit crimes with up to 4 people!</h3><br><br><br>

                <p>We've been working on adding local multiplayer for all the couch co-op heads out there (and because it's a lot easier than online multiplayer). The majority of this update was focussed on adding multiplayer, so we didn't do much else in regards to small, tiny, unremarkable stuff like bug fixing, balancing, or improving gameplay. Heck, we've probably tripled the amount of bugs in this update alone; the glitches and crashes are a feature!</p>

                <br><h2><b>The Future</b></h2>

                <p style="font-size: 16px">With Next Fest waiting around the corner to steal my will to live, we're going to focus on bug fixes and optimizations to give everyone a more stable and comfortable experience!</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px">We're also going to focus on adding some additional bonus levels, as well as adding and improving a lot of the unlockable cosmetics. Current progress towards game completion is still around 10%. We worked on a bit of extra stuff, but not too much. Actually, it's probably closer to 11% at this point.</p>

                <br><h2><b>New Features</b></h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added local multiplayer (just in general, this deserves its own bullet point).</li>
                    <li>Added local multiplayer to Infinite Mode.</li>
                    <li>Added "friendly fire" modifier.</li>
                    <li>Added Deathmatch.</li>
                    <li>Added 4 new Deathmatch maps, designed for 4 player PvP.</li>
                    <li>Added the following stats:</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 16px;">Other players killed.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 16px;">Damage dealt to other players.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 16px;">Multiplayer Infinite Mode games played.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 16px;">Deathmatches played.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 16px;">Additional player controllers connected.</li>
                    <li>Added customization randomization. You can truly randomize your cosmetics, or randomly choose one preset costume to wear.</li>
                    <li>The game is now more clear about when and what is saved.</li>
                    <li>The weapon swapping buttons are now used in level selection menus to go to the previous or next maps.</li>
                    <li>Quartermaster Unicorn, the War Profiteer, and their text are now animated on shop screens.</li>
                </ul>

                <br><h2><b>Bug Fixes</b></h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed a bug where, when exiting some levels, the game would transition to the world map 30 times, causing lag.</li>
                    <li>Fixed errors regarding the mouse cursor when switching between controller and mouse-based aiming.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an error that caused the player to aim their weapon at the cursor's position when not aiming while using a controller.</li>
                    <li>Fixed errors with scroll sliders not scrolling properly when clicked or held.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Version 0.0.010 - 9/13/24</h2>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Demo Pre-Alpha Update</b></h2>
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Optimization, GUI Improvements, and Accessibility Features</h3><br><br><br>

                <p>We've been working hard to prepare Clippy Commando for the October Next Fest. The highlights include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The damage and input systems have been overhauled, which should help performance on lower end systems and improve scalability for future additions to the game.</li>
                    <li>Various accessibility features.</li>
                    <li>An overhaul of various GUI elements, and a rework of the dialogue GUI from scratch. All text elements had to be updated, too, since I switched from using GameMaker's built in text drawing functions to <a href="https://www.jujuadams.com/Scribble/#/latest/">Juju Adams' Scribble library</a>.</li>
                </ul>



                <br><h2><b>The Future</b></h2>

                <p style="font-size: 16px">We've been working on implementing local multiplayer! This feature isn't in a state we're ready to release yet, but should be finished for the next update. Using Steam's Remote Play Together framework, this functionally allows for online multiplayer while we work on implementing a dedicated online system.</p>
                
                <p style="font-size: 16px">Bug fixes and optimizations will be a main focus as we polish the demo for Next Fest. We want to give all players a stable and comfortable experience.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px">We plan on updating the demo with some additional content, mainly additional bonus levels, modifiers, and unlockable cosmetics. However, as the demo creeps towards its "finished" state, we are transitioning to finishing implementation of content that will only be available in the full game, like the 9 new weapons we added in this update that don't appear in the demo.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px">Current progress towards game completion is around 10%.</p>

                <br><h2><b>Balance Changes</b></h2>
                <ul>

                    <li>All enemies (excluding the gluer, gluer stick, and corrector fluid) are now impacted by glue (and corrector fluid, if the modifier is enabled) stickiness like the player. All enemies are now impacted by bushes.</li>
                    <li>Bushes now reduce bullet pierce by 0.25 rather than 0.</li>
                    <li>Damaging environmental objects like bushes and crates now adds to the score.</li>

                <br><h2><b>Bug Fixes</b></h2>

                <br>
                <p>Controllers</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed various errors resulting in incorrect controller input.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an error that caused controller input to not be picked up if the controller was connected after the game started.</li>
                    <li>Updated controller configuration in Steamworks to match current input methods.</li>
                    <li>Updated the default controller button layout for the full game and the demo.</li>
                </ul>



                <br>
                <p>Saving and Loading</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed an error where some items without ammo (the chapter 2 no cutscene cell key specifically for some reason) could crash the game when auto-saving.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an error that caused save files to be deleted if the game was exited unnaturally before "officially" saving (before reaching the world map).</li>
                    <li>Temporary save files are now saved immediately after launching the game rather than after loading the appropriate save slot.</li>
                </ul>



                <br>
                <p>Infinite Mode</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Leaderboards now default to global rather than friends to make the game seem more active.</li>
                    <li>Fixed error that caused weekly challenges to be submitted to the leaderboard of the respective map rather than the weekly challenge leaderboard.</li>
                    <li>Locked levels now show their unlock chapter in the level select rather than "???".</li>
                    <li>Infinite Mode no longer crashes after beating wave 26. Innovative for an "infinite" mode, I know.</li>
                </ul>



                <br>
                <p>Story Mode</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed an error that caused the pacifist medal in chapter 1 to only be obtainable with cutscenes on.</li>
                    <li>Updated the narrator's "voice" to sound less gross and disgusting.</li>
                    <li>Fixed a bug where pausing in Bonus Level 1 would cause the enemies to stop shooting. I have literally 0 clue what was causing the issue, but it's fixed now.</li>
                </ul>



                <br>
                <p>Inventory</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed an error that caused assigning nothing (the weapon) to an empty inventory slot would crash the game.</li>
                    <li>Fixed weapon swapping functionality; if a weapon is already in the player's inventory and they attempt to assign it somewhere else, it will now do that instead of doing nothing.</li>
                    <li>Weapons should now correctly keep track of ammo, even when swapped or removed from the player's inventory.</li>
                </ul>



                <br>
                <p>Civilians</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Civilians can now come in multiple races to diversify your war crimes.</li>
                    <li>Civilians now stop completely when the player comes near them, but only if they're in front of their current escape route.</li>
                    <li>Civilians now despawn even when the player can see them to prevent farming money and war crimes.</li>
                    <li>Children now have unique bits.</li>
                </ul>



                <br>
                <p>Everything Else</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Compressed some audio, resulting in a ~30% reduction in game file size.</li>
                    <li>Rewrote damage system to improve optimization and scalability.</li>
                    <li>Optimized bushes considerably.</li>
                    <li>Fixed various issues with the camera.</li>
                    <li>For some reason, the Infinite Mode modifier objects and buttons were active even when not in the menu, and they used a considerable amount of resources to do nothing and be dumb.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an error that caused the game to crash when a taper couldn't figure out what it was taping.</li>
                    <li>Fixed pistol and revolver bullets having wonky hitboxes.</li>
                    <li>Fixed error that caused the "total teleports" stat to be incorrectly tracked.</li>
                    <li>Fixed error that caused the "times run into enemy" stat to increment when taking any damage, regardless of source.</li>
                    <li>Fixed error that caused ambience particles (clouds, wind, leaves) to continue to move while the game was paused (noticeable in hit pauses and during level ups).</li>
                    <li>I forgot to add the period to the outlined damage number fonts, making numbers like "7.50" appear as "750". Oopsie.</li>
                    <li>Fixed issues with the chapter 1 level node in the demo location.</li>
                    <li>The Steam button on the main menu now links to Clippy Commando's store page rather than Steam's main page.</li>
                    <li>Damage number visuals were tweaked slightly.</li>
                    <li>Fonts are now credited.</li>
                    <li>Text displays for time played are no longer modulo'd by 24.</li>
                    <li>The Quillshire Prison warden now has his own unique sprites and is also not asleep and also also doesn't have a hat ever now.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an error that caused the player's eyes and hat to draw over their weapon. This has been in the game for months and no one ever noticed it.</li>
                    <li>Changed enemy depths to be from the bottom of their sprite to the center.</li>
                </ul>
